## Delivery Time, Diwali Sales, Mortality Life Expectancy Prediction using Machine Learning Techniques

**Abstract**

This project explores the application of machine learning techniques to predict delivery time, Diwali sales, and mortality life expectancy. We utilize three datasets:

* Delivery dataset: Contains information about delivery times, delivery personnel, and delivery locations.
* Diwali sales dataset: Includes customer demographics, product information, and sales figures during the Diwali festival.
* Mortality life expectancy dataset: Provides data on mortality rates, life expectancy, and other health indicators for various countries.

We employ five machine learning algorithms:

* Decision Tree: Used for classification and regression tasks, offering interpretability and flexibility.
* K-means clustering: Identifies unlabeled data patterns and segments data into distinct groups.
* Linear Regression: Models the linear relationship between a dependent variable and independent variables.
* Polynomial Regression: Captures non-linear relationships between variables by incorporating higher-order polynomial terms.
* Naive Bayes: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, efficient for text classification tasks.

## Introduction

This section elaborates on the concept of delivery time, Diwali sales, and mortality life expectancy datasets, highlighting their significance in data mining and machine learning applications.

## Related Work

This section provides a review of existing research on machine learning and data mining techniques used in similar contexts, emphasizing their contributions and potential limitations.

## Methodology

### A. Summary of Datasets

* Delivery dataset: Details on delivery times, personnel, locations, and other service attributes.
* Diwali sales dataset: Customer information, product details, and sales figures during Diwali.
* Mortality life expectancy dataset: Provides data on health indicators across various countries.

### B. Data Preparation

* **Data Cleaning:** Identifies and corrects errors, inconsistencies, and missing values within the datasets.
* **Handling Outliers:** Detects and addresses outliers that may significantly deviate from the general trend.

## Model Building and Results

This section details the process of building and evaluating machine learning models for each prediction task.

* **Decision Tree:** Explored for the mortality life expectancy dataset, with visualizations depicting actual vs. predicted values, z-score distribution, and actual values without outliers.
* **K-means Model:** Applied to the delivery time dataset, with visualizations showcasing the distribution of restaurant latitude by cluster and a scatterplot matrix with cluster colors.
* **Linear Regression Model:** Used for the Diwali sales data, with visualizations including a scatterplot of observed vs. predicted values and a boxplot of User_ID by Product_ID.
* **Polynomial Regression:** Employed for the mortality life expectancy dataset, with visualizations featuring a boxplot of residuals and a comparison of clean data and model fit.
* **Naive Bayes:** Utilized for the Diwali sales data, with visualizations including a boxplot before outliers, a confusion matrix heatmap, and a histogram of age.

## Conclusion

The project emphasizes the strengths and weaknesses of various machine learning models, including:

* Decision Tree: Easy to use, interpretable, and provides clear decision-making processes.
* K-means clustering: Effective for pattern recognition and data segmentation.
* Linear Regression: Models linear relationships between variables.
* Polynomial Regression: Captures non-linear relationships.
* Naive Bayes: Efficient for text classification tasks under specific assumptions.

The optimal model selection depends on the specific data characteristics and project goals. Understanding these models empowers practitioners to make informed decisions for data-driven tasks.
